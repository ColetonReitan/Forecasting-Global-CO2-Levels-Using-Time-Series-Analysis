To forecast the rate at which atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing globally, I will be performing a
time series analysis on the atmospheric concentration of CO2 based on data from an observatory located
in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The use of simple forecasting models such as Holt-Winters seasonal smoothing and
moderately advanced forecasting models such as an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
model will be used to determine these forecasted values. By the end of this analysis, there should be an
understanding of not only the rate of increase of which CO2 levels are rising globally, but also where these
levels could potentially rise to in coming years.

# Forecasting Global CO2 Levels - A time series analysis

This was a semester long project conducted in the fall of 2021. This analysis includes data ETL, EDA & supervised machine learning modeling for time series analysis.    
Completed fully within R

## Project Overview
To forecast the rate at which atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing globally, I performed a
time series analysis on the atmospheric concentration of CO2 based on data from an observatory located
in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The use of simple forecasting models such as Holt-Winters seasonal smoothing and
moderately advanced forecasting models such as an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
model was used to determine the forecasted values. As a result of this analysis, there is an
understanding of not only the rate of increase of which CO2 levels are rising globally, but also where these
levels could potentially rise to in coming years.


## Research Questions

## Data
The data is from the Global Monitoring Lab located in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, taken from the FRED. The dating of the data goes back as far as 1960 through 2021. There are roughly 750 observations across 5 features. 

### Variables
Year: The year in which the data is from  
Month: The month in which the data is from (1-12)  
Decimal.Date: The date in which the data is from in numeric form  
Average: Average Atmospheric Level of CO2 (PPM)  
Interpolated: Secondary reading of average atmospheric level of CO2 (PPM)
